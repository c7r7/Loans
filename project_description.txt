LoanIQ Project Description

1. Features
- Automated Metadata Extraction: Automatically ingests PDF loan agreements and extracts key data (Borrower, Margins, Covenants, Governing Law) into structured JSON using a hybrid AI/regex engine.
- Interactive "AI Analyst" Dashboard: A centralized glassmorphic interface where users can view documents and extracted data side-by-side.
- Audio Briefings: Converts dense legal text into audio summaries using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech, allowing users to listen to deal terms.
- One-Click PowerPoint Generation: Programmatically creates professional slide decks summarizing key risk factors and loan details for executive presentations.
- Portfolio Management: Stores extracted data in a lightweight JSON database for future retrieval and comparison.
